## ABSTRACT
"Dilettante's Muse" is an innovative TypeScript-based web application that aims to introduce clueless art lovers to famous works of art from the Metropolitan Museum of Art (MET), and offers access to art for individuals who cannot physically visit the museum. The application leverages the Metropolitan Museum of Art API to fetch data about the art pieces. The MVP of "Dilettante's Muse" includes features such as displaying art pieces from the MET, allowing users to favorite and unfavorite pieces, and providing a view for their favorite selections. Additionally, the app incorporates React Router, enabling a multi-page experience for users to interact with and explore art data more effectively.
